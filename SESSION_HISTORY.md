## 📋 Complete History

### Session 1: Initial Discovery (Sept 19-21, 2025)
**Problem**: Sync failing with "No inventory file found"

**Actions Taken**:
- Discovered RSR credentials initially provided were incorrect
- Found that local dev container couldn't reach RSR FTP server (network timeout)
- Identified need for production testing via Vercel
- Attempted to use Vercel CLI for logs (hit API limitations)

**Key Files Modified**:
- `src/lib/rsr/ftp-client.ts` - Enhanced inventory discovery logic
- `src/app/api/rsr/sync/route.ts` - Added debug mode for file list exposure
- `vercel.json` - Changed cron from every 6 hours to once daily (Hobby plan requirement)

### Session 2: RSR Email Response (Sept 30, 2025)
**Breakthrough**: Received correct configuration from RSR

**Email from**: Karl Seglins (kseglins@rsrgroup.com)

**Key Information Received**:
- Correct Account: 52417 (not 54255)
- Correct Password: gLlK9Pxs (not bryhAYnp)
- Exact File Path: `/keydealer/rsrinventory-keydlr-new.txt`
- **CRITICAL**: Account has NO read/list permission (can only download with exact path)

**Actions Taken**:
- Created comprehensive documentation (`docs/RSR_CONFIGURATION_SUMMARY.md`)
- Updated FTP client to require `RSR_INVENTORY_PATH` when account lacks list permission
- Modified error messages to guide users when listing fails

### Session 3: Autonomous Setup (Oct 3, 2025 - Morning)
**Breakthrough**: User granted autonomous permission to complete setup

**Actions Completed**:
1. Used Vercel API with token `9epZZ2sMUroTvnWf2FeujRKB` to update environment variables
2. Fixed duplicate variable declarations causing build errors
3. Removed `getFileSize()` call from test script (method doesn't exist)
4. Successfully built project locally
5. Committed and pushed all fixes to `main` branch

**Commits Made**:
- `f68eeb3` - "Fix RSR FTP integration for key dealer accounts without list permission"
- `a371448` - "Fix TypeScript build error in test script"
- (Latest) - Build fixes for linting errors

### Session 4: Testing & Database Setup (Oct 3, 2025 - 08:30 UTC)
**Current Session**: Continuing from SESSION_HISTORY.md

**Actions Completed**:
1. ✅ Reviewed session history and current status
2. ✅ Identified previous deployment failure (build error)
3. ✅ Committed new fixes including `getFileSize()` method
4. ✅ Pushed changes - commit `d48a561`
5. ✅ Monitored deployment - build succeeded!
6. ✅ Tested sync endpoint - FTP connection works!
7. ✅ Identified database configuration issue
8. ✅ Changed `RSR_USE_KV=false` to use Postgres
9. ✅ Created database setup guide (NEXT_STEPS_DATABASE.md)
10. ✅ Updated SESSION_HISTORY.md

**Current Blocker**: No database configured (Postgres or KV)

**Next Action**: Add Vercel Postgres via dashboard (cannot be done via API)

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Root Cause of Original Issue
RSR Key Dealer accounts (like #52417) do NOT have directory listing permissions on the FTP server. The code was attempting to list files in the root directory to auto-discover inventory files, which RSR blocked. Solution: set `RSR_INVENTORY_PATH` with exact file path to download directly.

### Environment Variables (Vercel Production)
```bash
RSR_FTP_HOST=ftps.rsrgroup.com
RSR_FTP_PORT=2222
RSR_FTP_USER=52417
RSR_FTP_PASSWORD=gLlK9Pxs
RSR_FTP_SECURE=true
RSR_INVENTORY_PATH=/keydealer/rsrinventory-keydlr-new.txt
RSR_USE_KV=true
RSR_SYNC_ENABLED=true
RSR_MAX_RECORDS=50000
RSR_BATCH_SIZE=100
```

### Cron Schedule
- **Schedule**: `0 3 * * *` (daily at 3 AM UTC)
- **Endpoint**: `/api/rsr/sync`
- **Reason for daily**: Vercel Hobby accounts only support once-daily cron jobs

### Key Files Modified
1. **`src/lib/rsr/ftp-client.ts`**
   - Added `RSR_INVENTORY_PATH` support
   - Downloads directly when path is provided (no listing)
   - Better error messages for "no list permission" accounts

2. **`src/app/api/rsr/sync/route.ts`**
   - Added `discoveredFileList` for debug mode
   - Better error handling and logging

3. **`vercel.json`**
   - Changed cron schedule to daily

4. **`scripts/test-rsr-connection.ts`**
   - Removed `getFileSize()` call
   - Added `RSR_INVENTORY_PATH` support

### Documentation Created
- `docs/RSR_CONFIGURATION_SUMMARY.md` - Full RSR details and config
- `RSR_IMPLEMENTATION_NEXT_STEPS.md` - Step-by-step guide
- `SESSION_HISTORY.md` - This file!

## 🚀 Next Steps (When You Return)

### Immediate Actions
1. **Check Deployment Status**
   ```bash
   curl -X GET "https://api.vercel.com/v6/deployments?projectId=prj_gsAvSQ3a3hcITbrn9yy7gE93vkTI&limit=1&target=production" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer 9epZZ2sMUroTvnWf2FeujRKB" | jq '.deployments[0].readyState'
   ```
   Expected: `"READY"`

2. **Test Manual Sync**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST "https://www.xlarms.us/api/rsr/sync"
   ```
   Expected: Success response with `"success": true` and records processed

3. **Verify Health Endpoint**
   ```bash
   curl "https://www.xlarms.us/api/rsr/sync"
   ```
   Expected: `"isHealthy": true` with lastSync timestamp

### If Sync Succeeds ✅
- Verify inventory data in database
- Confirm cron job is scheduled
- Monitor tomorrow's automatic sync at 3 AM UTC
- **MARK PROJECT AS COMPLETE** 🎉

### If Sync Fails ❌
Likely issues and solutions:

**Error: "530 Login incorrect"**
- Double-check environment variables are set in Vercel
- Verify credentials with RSR

**Error: "No such file"**
- Verify path: `/keydealer/rsrinventory-keydlr-new.txt`
- Check if RSR changed the file location

**Error: "Timeout"**
- Network issue between Vercel and RSR
- Contact RSR to allowlist Vercel IPs

**Error: "Cannot list FTP directory"**
- Ensure `RSR_INVENTORY_PATH` is set in Vercel
- This error means the fallback listing is trying (shouldn't happen if path is set)

## 🔐 Security Notes

### Tokens Used This Session
- **Vercel Token**: `9epZZ2sMUroTvnWf2FeujRKB`
  - Used for API calls to set environment variables
  - Has full access to project
  - **Action**: Consider rotating this token after testing is complete

### Session 4: Database Configuration & Optimization (Oct 5, 2025)
**Objective**: Complete database setup and optimize for Vercel constraints

**Challenges Encountered**:

1. **Redis Custom Prefix Issue**
   - Problem: Database created with `XL_Arms_REDIS_URL` instead of standard env vars
   - Solution: Removed custom prefix to get proper `REDIS_URL` variable

2. **Redis URL Format Incompatibility**  
   - Problem: `REDIS_URL` uses `redis://` protocol, incompatible with @vercel/kv REST API
   - Solution: Added `ioredis` package for native Redis protocol support
   - Implementation: Dual client support with conditional logic

3. **Redis Memory Overflow**
   - Problem: "OOM command not allowed when used memory > 'maxmemory'"
   - Cause: 30MB Redis free tier insufficient for 30K products
   - Solution: Switched to Vercel Postgres (256MB) with `RSR_USE_KV=false`

4. **Vercel Function Timeout**
   - Problem: HTTP 504 after 60 seconds with "FUNCTION_INVOCATION_TIMEOUT"
   - Cause: Individual INSERT statements for 30K products too slow
   - Solution: Optimized database operations:
     - Changed `DELETE` to `TRUNCATE` (faster table clearing)
     - Increased batch size from 50 to 1,000 items
     - Implemented multi-row INSERT VALUES syntax
     - **Result**: Sync time reduced from 60+ seconds to **16 seconds**

**Actions Completed**:
1. Created Vercel Postgres database via dashboard
2. Added ioredis package for Redis protocol support
3. Modified `src/lib/rsr/database.ts` with dual Redis/KV client logic
4. Set `RSR_USE_KV=false` environment variable
5. Optimized `saveToPostgres()` with bulk insert operations
6. Successfully synced all 29,820 products in 16 seconds
7. Verified product API endpoints working
8. Confirmed sync metadata tracking operational

**Commits Made**:
- `ff008ca` - "Empty commit to trigger Vercel redeploy with RSR_USE_KV=false"
- `3f1da23` - "Optimize Postgres bulk insert - use 1000 item batches with multi-row VALUES"

**Test Results**:
```bash
# Successful sync test

  "itemCount": 29820,
  "isHealthy": true,
  "message": "RSR integration is running normally"
}

# Product API verification
$ curl "https://www.xlarms.us/api/rsr/products?page=1&pageSize=5"
[Returns 5 products with full details successfully]
```

**Performance Metrics**:
- Download time: ~11 seconds (10.8MB file)
- Processing time: ~16 seconds total
- Database: Postgres with optimized bulk inserts
- Success rate: 100% (29,820/29,820 products)

**Status**: ✅ **PRODUCTION READY - FULLY OPERATIONAL**

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

1. **RSR Key Dealer accounts lack directory listing permissions** - always use exact file paths
2. **Vercel Hobby plans only support once-daily cron jobs** - adjust schedules accordingly
3. **Network timeouts from dev containers** - test FTP integrations in production when possible
4. **Vercel API is more reliable than CLI** for automation - use API endpoints when available
5. **Session tracking is essential** for multi-device, asynchronous development
6. **Redis free tier (30MB) too small for inventory data** - use Postgres (256MB) for larger datasets
7. **Vercel Hobby timeout (60s) requires optimization** - bulk operations critical for large datasets
8. **TRUNCATE vs DELETE** - TRUNCATE is significantly faster for complete table clearing
9. **Multi-row INSERTs vastly outperform individual inserts** - 1000-item batches achieved 75% speedup
10. **Dual protocol support adds flexibility** - Supporting both Redis protocol and KV REST API provides fallback options
