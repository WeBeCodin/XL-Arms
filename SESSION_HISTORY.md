# RSR FTP Integration - Session History & Status

**Last Updated**: October 3, 2025, 07:40 UTC  
**Current Status**: ‚úÖ **ENVIRONMENT CONFIGURED - READY FOR TESTING**  
**Next Action**: Wait for Vercel deployment to complete, then test sync endpoint

---

## üéØ Current Task Status

### What We're Doing
Integrating RSR Group's FTP inventory feed into the XL-Arms e-commerce platform with automatic daily synchronization.

### Where We Are Now
1. ‚úÖ **Environment Variables Set in Vercel** (via API)
   - RSR_FTP_USER = 52417 (corrected from 54255)
   - RSR_FTP_PASSWORD = gLlK9Pxs (corrected from bryhAYnp)
   - RSR_INVENTORY_PATH = /keydealer/rsrinventory-keydlr-new.txt (NEW - required!)

2. ‚úÖ **Code Changes Committed & Pushed**
   - Fixed FTP client to download directly when RSR_INVENTORY_PATH is set
   - Updated sync route with better error handling
   - Fixed TypeScript build errors
   - Adjusted cron schedule to once daily (Hobby account requirement)

3. üü° **Waiting for Deployment**
   - Latest commits pushed to `main` branch
   - Vercel is building the new deployment
   - Build was successful locally (verified)

4. ‚è≠Ô∏è **Next Step**: Test the sync endpoint once deployment completes

## üìã Complete History

### Session 1: Initial Discovery (Sept 19-21, 2025)
**Problem**: Sync failing with "No inventory file found"

**Actions Taken**:
- Discovered RSR credentials initially provided were incorrect
- Found that local dev container couldn't reach RSR FTP server (network timeout)
- Identified need for production testing via Vercel
- Attempted to use Vercel CLI for logs (hit API limitations)

**Key Files Modified**:
- `src/lib/rsr/ftp-client.ts` - Enhanced inventory discovery logic
- `src/app/api/rsr/sync/route.ts` - Added debug mode for file list exposure
- `vercel.json` - Changed cron from every 6 hours to once daily (Hobby plan requirement)

### Session 2: RSR Email Response (Sept 30, 2025)
**Breakthrough**: Received correct configuration from RSR

**Email from**: Karl Seglins (kseglins@rsrgroup.com)

**Key Information Received**:
- Correct Account: 52417 (not 54255)
- Correct Password: gLlK9Pxs (not bryhAYnp)
- Exact File Path: `/keydealer/rsrinventory-keydlr-new.txt`
- **CRITICAL**: Account has NO read/list permission (can only download with exact path)

**Actions Taken**:
- Created comprehensive documentation (`docs/RSR_CONFIGURATION_SUMMARY.md`)
- Updated FTP client to require `RSR_INVENTORY_PATH` when account lacks list permission
- Modified error messages to guide users when listing fails

### Session 3: Autonomous Setup (Oct 3, 2025)
**Breakthrough**: User granted autonomous permission to complete setup

**Actions Completed**:
1. Used Vercel API with token `9epZZ2sMUroTvnWf2FeujRKB` to update environment variables
2. Fixed duplicate variable declarations causing build errors
3. Removed `getFileSize()` call from test script (method doesn't exist)
4. Successfully built project locally
5. Committed and pushed all fixes to `main` branch

**Commits Made**:
- `f68eeb3` - "Fix RSR FTP integration for key dealer accounts without list permission"
- `a371448` - "Fix TypeScript build error in test script"
- (Latest) - Build fixes for linting errors

## üîß Technical Details

### Root Cause of Original Issue
RSR Key Dealer accounts (like #52417) do NOT have directory listing permissions on the FTP server. The code was attempting to list files in the root directory to auto-discover inventory files, which RSR blocked. Solution: set `RSR_INVENTORY_PATH` with exact file path to download directly.

### Environment Variables (Vercel Production)
```bash
RSR_FTP_HOST=ftps.rsrgroup.com
RSR_FTP_PORT=2222
RSR_FTP_USER=52417
RSR_FTP_PASSWORD=gLlK9Pxs
RSR_FTP_SECURE=true
RSR_INVENTORY_PATH=/keydealer/rsrinventory-keydlr-new.txt
RSR_USE_KV=true
RSR_SYNC_ENABLED=true
RSR_MAX_RECORDS=50000
RSR_BATCH_SIZE=100
```

### Cron Schedule
- **Schedule**: `0 3 * * *` (daily at 3 AM UTC)
- **Endpoint**: `/api/rsr/sync`
- **Reason for daily**: Vercel Hobby accounts only support once-daily cron jobs

### Key Files Modified
1. **`src/lib/rsr/ftp-client.ts`**
   - Added `RSR_INVENTORY_PATH` support
   - Downloads directly when path is provided (no listing)
   - Better error messages for "no list permission" accounts

2. **`src/app/api/rsr/sync/route.ts`**
   - Added `discoveredFileList` for debug mode
   - Better error handling and logging

3. **`vercel.json`**
   - Changed cron schedule to daily

4. **`scripts/test-rsr-connection.ts`**
   - Removed `getFileSize()` call
   - Added `RSR_INVENTORY_PATH` support

### Documentation Created
- `docs/RSR_CONFIGURATION_SUMMARY.md` - Full RSR details and config
- `RSR_IMPLEMENTATION_NEXT_STEPS.md` - Step-by-step guide
- `SESSION_HISTORY.md` - This file!

## üöÄ Next Steps (When You Return)

### Immediate Actions
1. **Check Deployment Status**
   ```bash
   curl -X GET "https://api.vercel.com/v6/deployments?projectId=prj_gsAvSQ3a3hcITbrn9yy7gE93vkTI&limit=1&target=production" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer 9epZZ2sMUroTvnWf2FeujRKB" | jq '.deployments[0].readyState'
   ```
   Expected: `"READY"`

2. **Test Manual Sync**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST "https://www.xlarms.us/api/rsr/sync"
   ```
   Expected: Success response with `"success": true` and records processed

3. **Verify Health Endpoint**
   ```bash
   curl "https://www.xlarms.us/api/rsr/sync"
   ```
   Expected: `"isHealthy": true` with lastSync timestamp

### If Sync Succeeds ‚úÖ
- Verify inventory data in database
- Confirm cron job is scheduled
- Monitor tomorrow's automatic sync at 3 AM UTC
- **MARK PROJECT AS COMPLETE** üéâ

### If Sync Fails ‚ùå
Likely issues and solutions:

**Error: "530 Login incorrect"**
- Double-check environment variables are set in Vercel
- Verify credentials with RSR

**Error: "No such file"**
- Verify path: `/keydealer/rsrinventory-keydlr-new.txt`
- Check if RSR changed the file location

**Error: "Timeout"**
- Network issue between Vercel and RSR
- Contact RSR to allowlist Vercel IPs

**Error: "Cannot list FTP directory"**
- Ensure `RSR_INVENTORY_PATH` is set in Vercel
- This error means the fallback listing is trying (shouldn't happen if path is set)

## üéì Lessons Learned

1. **RSR Key Dealer accounts lack directory listing permissions** - always use exact file paths
2. **Vercel Hobby plans only support once-daily cron jobs** - adjust schedules accordingly
3. **Network timeouts from dev containers** - test FTP integrations in production when possible
4. **Vercel API is more reliable than CLI** for automation - use API endpoints when available
5. **Session tracking is essential** for multi-device, asynchronous development

---

**Status**: Ready to test once deployment completes. All configuration is in place. üöÄ
