# RSR Integration - Current Status Summary
**Date**: October 5, 2025  
**Session**: Parser Validation & Production Testing

---

## üéâ Major Accomplishments

### ‚úÖ What's Working
1. **FTP Connection**: Successfully connecting to RSR's FTPS server
   - Host: ftps.rsrgroup.com:2222
   - Account: 52417 (Key Dealer)
   - File: /keydealer/rsrinventory-keydlr-new.txt (10.8 MB)
   - Health check: ‚úÖ HEALTHY (526ms response time)

2. **Inventory Parser**: 100% validated with real RSR data
   - Tested with 29,820 actual products
   - All field mappings corrected
   - Price vs Retail Price fixed (were swapped)
   - Successfully parsing in production

3. **Code Deployed**: All fixes are live on www.xlarms.us
   - Parser corrections deployed
   - Debug endpoints added
   - Health monitoring working

## ‚ö†Ô∏è What's Blocking

### Database Not Configured
The sync process successfully:
- ‚úÖ Connects to FTP
- ‚úÖ Downloads inventory file (11 seconds)
- ‚úÖ Parses all products

But then fails at the **database save step** because:
- ‚ùå No Vercel KV database exists
- ‚ùå No Vercel Postgres database exists
- ‚ùå `RSR_USE_KV` is set to `"false"` (should be `"true"`)

**Error Message**:
```
Postgres save failed: VercelPostgresError - 'missing_connection_string'
```

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Fix (Required Action)

### Step 1: Create Vercel KV Database
1. Visit: https://vercel.com/webecodins-projects/xl-arms
2. Click "Storage" tab ‚Üí "Create Database"
3. Select "**KV (Redis)**"
4. Name: `xl-arms-rsr-inventory`
5. Region: Choose closest to your users (e.g., US East)
6. Click "Create"

Vercel will automatically add these environment variables:
- `KV_REST_API_URL`
- `KV_REST_API_TOKEN`
- `KV_REST_API_READ_ONLY_TOKEN`
- `KV_URL`

### Step 2: Update RSR_USE_KV to "true"

**Option A**: Using Vercel Dashboard (Easiest)
1. Go to: https://vercel.com/webecodins-projects/xl-arms/settings/environment-variables
2. Find `RSR_USE_KV`
3. Click "Edit"
4. Change value from `false` to `true`
5. Click "Save"
6. Redeploy (automatic)

**Option B**: Using API (If you prefer automation)
```bash
curl -X PATCH "https://api.vercel.com/v10/projects/prj_gsAvSQ3a3hcITbrn9yy7gE93vkTI/env/0ufLe8a7zKSXRhSO" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer 9epZZ2sMUroTvnWf2FeujRKB" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"value":"true","target":["production","preview","development"]}'
```

### Step 3: Test the Sync
Wait ~60 seconds for automatic redeployment, then:

```bash
# Test manual sync
curl -X POST "https://www.xlarms.us/api/rsr/sync"

# Should see success response with:
{
  "success": true,
  "recordsProcessed": 29820,
  "recordsAdded": 29820,
  "syncDate": "2025-10-05T...",
  "processingTime": ~30000  // 30 seconds for full sync
}
```

## üìä Expected Results After Fix

### First Sync
- **Duration**: ~30-60 seconds (full 29,820 products)
- **Records Added**: 29,820
- **Database Size**: ~15-20 MB in KV
- **Status**: All products available via API

### Subsequent Syncs
- **Schedule**: Daily at 3 AM UTC (cron job)
- **Duration**: ~30-60 seconds
- **Updates**: Price changes, quantity updates, new products

### API Endpoints (After Successful Sync)
```bash
# Get all products
curl "https://www.xlarms.us/api/rsr/products"

# Get product by stock number
curl "https://www.xlarms.us/api/rsr/products?stockNumber=17912WH-1-SBL-R"

# Get sync status
curl "https://www.xlarms.us/api/rsr/sync"  # GET for status

# Trigger manual sync
curl -X POST "https://www.xlarms.us/api/rsr/sync"
```

## üìà What We Learned

### Parser Field Mapping (Corrected)
```
Field 1:  Stock Number (17912WH-1-SBL-R)
Field 2:  UPC (816161020234)
Field 3:  Description (1791 2 WAY IWB STEALTH BLK RH SIZE 1)
Field 4:  Department (14)
Field 5:  Manufacturer ID (1791)
Field 6:  Retail Price/MSRP ($50.99) ‚Üê Was incorrectly mapped
Field 7:  Dealer Cost/Your Price ($29.27) ‚Üê Was incorrectly mapped
Field 8:  Quantity (6)
Field 9:  Weight (0)
Field 10: Category (2 Way Holster)
Field 11: Manufacturer Name (1791 Gunleather)
Field 12: Model (2WH-1-SBL-R)
Field 13: Special Status (Closeout/empty)
Field 14: Full Description
Field 15: Image URL (17912WH-1-SBL-R_1.jpg)
Fields 16-69: Mostly empty
Field 70: Date (20210420)
Field 71: Alternate Price ($48.99)
Fields 73-75: Shipping Dimensions (7.50 x 6.50 x 2.00)
Field 76: Availability (Y)
Fields 77+: Additional flags/metadata
```

### Sample Products (from real data)
| Stock # | Description | Cost | MSRP | Qty | Mfg |
|---------|-------------|------|------|-----|-----|
| 17912WH-1-SBL-R | 1791 2 WAY IWB STEALTH BLK RH SIZE 1 | $29.27 | $50.99 | 6 | 1791 Gunleather |
| 17914WH-5-SBL-R | 1791 4 WAY IWB/OWB STLTH BLK RH SZ 5 | $30.99 | $53.99 | 45 | 1791 Gunleather |

## üîç Debug Tools Available

### Health Check
```bash
curl "https://www.xlarms.us/api/rsr/health"
```
Returns FTP connection status, response time, file size

### Environment Check
```bash
curl "https://www.xlarms.us/api/rsr/debug"
```
Shows all RSR env vars and database config

### Parser Test (Local)
```bash
cd /workspaces/XL-Arms
npx tsx scripts/test-rsr-parser.ts
```
Tests parser against real RSR file in `data/` folder

## üí∞ Costs

### Vercel KV (Redis) - FREE TIER
- 256 MB storage (more than enough for 30K products)
- 10K commands/day
- Perfect for this use case

### Alternative: Vercel Postgres - FREE TIER
- 256 MB storage
- 60 compute hours/month
- Works but KV is faster for this use case

### RSR Account
- Already active: Account #52417
- No additional costs

## üéØ Timeline to Complete

1. **Create KV Database**: 2 minutes
2. **Update RSR_USE_KV**: 1 minute
3. **Wait for Deployment**: 1 minute
4. **Test Sync**: 1 minute

**Total: ~5 minutes to go live!** üöÄ
